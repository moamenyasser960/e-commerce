There are three main phase:

    Front End: Whatever user see.

There are many technologies like:

HTML, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Jquery, Angular JS, React JS, BackBone JS etc.

    Back End: Middle ware for front end and database .

Languages:

Java, C#, PHP, Python, Ruby, C++, .Net, Node.js, Perl, Active VFP, ASP,  C, etc.

    Data Base: Stores data.

Mongo DB, Mysql, Oracle etc.
C#, R, PHP, and Python are some of the other widely used languages in this category.

Here I have listed only the popular technologies but there are many more technologies which can be also used.

So pick one technology from 2 and 3 each and for front end choose according to your easiness.

Thanks !!
